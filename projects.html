<h3>Master's Thesis, IIT Kanpur (May&rsquo;15- Ongoing)</h3>
<b>Rough Terrain Path Planning for a Biped Robot</b><br/>
<i>Under the guidance of <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~adutta">Prof. Ashish Dutta</a>, IIT Kanpur</i><br /> 
The objective was to a develop a footstep plan on a rough terrain for a 12DOF biped robot.
Kinematic and state transition model of biped for walking and turning over uneven terrain was developed and inverse dynamics was performedusing Euler-Lagrange approach. Energy minimization using GA was performed for a variety of turning angles, step-lengths and slopes to generate a database. 
Database was utlized to train two Neural Networks- for real-time pattern generation and energy estimation. Finally, an A* search to develop step-plan based on energy minimization on obstacle filled rough surface.

<b>Obstacle Avoidance using evolutionary approach</b><br/>
In this paper, the evolution of a recurrent neural network in order to control
an autonomous mobile robot is presented. Firstly, an environment containing
obstacles is created, a robot embedded with IR sensors and control system is
developed. The control architecture evolves in order to avoid the obstacles.
The performance of the discussed method is evaluated in different environ-
ments and a wide range of system parameters...<b><a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~gaurag/files/reportevo.pdf" >Read more</a></b><br/>

<h3>UG Project, IIT Kanpur  (Jun&rsquo;15-Sept&rsquo;15)</h3>
<b>Real Time Simulation of Human Gait</b><br/>
Human motion was captured using LEDs. The video was processed to yield joint trajectories. Inverse Kinematics
was performed to get joint angles during the gait cycle. Further, forward kinematics was performed
in real time to give antropomorphic motion in a simulated 6DOF biped...<b><a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~gaurag/files/gait_kinematics.pdf" >here</a></b><br/>

<h3>UG Research Project, IIT Kanpur  (Oct&rsquo;14-May&rsquo;15)</h3>
<b>Investigating the Self-Sensing Capabilities of Piezopatch in a Composite Laminate</b><br/>
A mathematical framework for evaluating the self-sensing capabilities of a piezoelectric patch.
The system comprises of a composite material with piezopatch embedded at a given location. The piezo is energized
via an input voltage which in turn induces strain in the piezo i.e. at this stage piezo acts as an induced strain actuator.
However, due to its interaction with the composite material stress is generated in the entire structure. This stress
further induces a voltage, thus harnessing the self-sensing capabilities of the piezo. A full length paper presented at
ISS NC7 organized by IISc Banagalore is available...<b><a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~gaurag/files/ISSSCP.pdf" >here</a></b><br/>

<h3>ME752A, IIT Kanpur  (Jan&rsquo;15-Apr&rsquo;15)</h3>
<b>Genetic Algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization of Weight of a Composite Plate</b><br/>
A multi-constraint combinotorial optimization methodology for the design of laminated
composite materials is presented. Maximum allowable displacement for given loading
condition was taken as the design constraint. The stacking sequence of layers and the
thickness of the structure were optimized for a preassigned geometry of the structure,
constituent materials and loading condition. Genetic algorithm was used for the opti-
mization process and the results for a sample problem show the validity of the proposed
methodology...<b><a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~gaurag/files/combopt.pdf" >Read more</a></b><br/>

<b>Democratic Consensus in Fish Swarms</b><br/>
In this study, we examine theory and an experiment conducted by Iain
Couzin et al to demonstrate that for a wide range of conditions, a
strongly opinionated minority can influence and dictate group choice,
but the presence of uninformed individuals spontaneously inhibits this
process, returning control to the numeric majority. The results of this
project emphasize the role of uninformed individuals in achieving
democratic consensus amid internal group conflict and informational
constraints...<b><a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~gaurag/files/reportdemo.pdf" >Read more</a></b><br/>

<b>Curve Kick Aerodynamics of Soccer Ball</b><br/>
Curling  trajectories are often observed in  association football. Attempts are continuously being made by current generation to repeat such motions. 
Velocity, point of impact and angular velocity are used as model parameter  and the effects of three forces, namely, the drag force, the Magnus force or the lift force and 
the  gravitational  force  are  considered.The model  constitutes a unifiedtheory of solid mechanics and fluid mechanics to 
determine the governing laws of motion for a spinning ball to predict the motion of soccer ball accurately close to the real world situations.
The paper presented at the 40th National Conference on Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Power in Dec, 2013 is... <b><a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~gaurag/files/FMFP.pdf" >here</a></b><br/>
